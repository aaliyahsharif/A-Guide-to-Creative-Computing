# A-Guide-to-Creative-Computing.
A few things I wish I had read before looking into creative computing for the first time. 

Honestly, when I heard we would be looking at creative computing in unit two I was nervous and felt a little unmotivated to take part in the CC week. Saying that seeems silly because I have never even really worked with computing - physical or creative. Despite this, the idea of it has always been something negative in my head after the years of hearing my friends that took Computer Science talking in basically a different languange about everything they did in their lessons. I never grew up with Xboxs or Wii's so technology and I have never been the best of friends which is why I have always tried to avoid it. 

Because of this, it is safe to say that I struggled this week however, looking back on it I am proud of myself for not giving up and instead learning enough that I may potentially help others.  
   

THE BEGINNING

I started my week gaining a basic understanding of creative computing, reading different resources provided as well as developing my understand of the basic principles and key terms.

MY LEARNING AND EXPERIENCE

Once I understood the basic terms of Creative Computing, I began looking into physical computing through Arduino. Before this, I had previous only maade circuits in year 9 science to learn about electricity (we used a few wires and a battery to light a bulb - really technical stuff).
